# QuinssentialQuintupletReg

This is acutally the second time I am doing this project. However, I wouldn't consider the first one to be a legit one as I literally copy from example with me just adding my own data set and train with argumen
parser. Hence, this time round, I will not use any argument parser in the code and also try to augment my dataset due to the fact that there is only a 50-100 for each class. AND IS NOT ANY IDEAL AMOUNT OF DATAS one should acquire to train. 

I will be using Jupyter notebook as this also part of my project for the module Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence (MLAI)

One more thing, the data that I will be using is using to do this CNN is the quinssential quintuplets. Out of the 5 sisters, I will attempt to recognize 2 sisters - Miku and Nino since they are mostly being loved by the community and have quite a lot of fan art being drawn about them.
